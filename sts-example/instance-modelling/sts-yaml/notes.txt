YAML-BASED GRAMMAR NOTES
------------------------

Most notables differences in comparison with Xtext default grammar:
(a) Indentation-based like Python

Ad (a):
Requires use of synthetic tokens (Xtext supports them) and changes to some generated classes, 
such as the formatter (see slide 72 in [2]).

The created YAML files in this folder are valid according to several YAML online validators [3,4,5].
