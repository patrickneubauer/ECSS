HUTN-BASED GRAMMAR NOTES
------------------------

Most notables differences in comparison with Xtext default grammar:
(a) identifier specification by the use of Strings in quotes (rather than without quotes)
(b) identifier referencing by the use of type/class followed by String in quotes
(c) use of colon for specification of primitive values or references
(d) syntax of enumerations is equal to those of identifiers, i.e. Strings in quotes
(e) arbitrary order of properties

Ad (b):
Although the generated default Xtext content assist suggests references
that are specified as Strings in quotes, selecting such a content assist suggestion
will result in a String without quotes, which introduces validation errors.

Ad (e):
See p.19 in [4] for how to implement this in Xtext. It requires disabling code-assist
and the implementation of a custom validator for duplicate single-valued properties to prevent overriding.

Example of grammar with arbitrary order:
( singleValuedProperty = Rule1 | muliValuedProperty += Rule2 )*
